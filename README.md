# Bootstrap-Tree-View
Bootstrap Tree view component has been written using Bootstrap framework.  It is absolutely free, open source and distributed under the MIT license. 

I have used bootstrap 3 and font awesome 4, but it can be easily used with other frameworks.

GETTING STARTED

Include bs-tree-view.css in your HTML file or copy the style and paste it to your custom css file. 
It has been written in LESS and Scss as well. :)
